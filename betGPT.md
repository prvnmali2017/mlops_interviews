Sure, let's outline the steps to develop, train, iterate, and deploy the "betgpt" model using PyTorch, perform feature engineering, perform bias detection, and deploy it on AWS EKS.

### 1. Model Development

First, let's develop the "betgpt" model using PyTorch. Since we're aiming for a Generative AI model, we'll use a pre-trained GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model from Hugging Face's Transformers library.

```python
import torch
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

class BetGPT:
    def __init__(self, model_name='gpt2'):
        self.tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
        self.model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

    def generate_text(self, prompt, max_length=50):
        input_ids = self.tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors='pt')
        output = self.model.generate(input_ids, max_length=max_length, num_return_sequences=1)
        return self.tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
```

### 2. Training the Model

Since we're using a pre-trained model, there's typically no need to train from scratch. However, fine-tuning on domain-specific data may be necessary.

### 3. Feature Engineering

Feature engineering for text data can involve techniques like tokenization, normalization, and embedding. In our case, we're using the GPT2 tokenizer which handles tokenization for us.

### 4. Bias Detection and Iteration

Bias detection involves analyzing model predictions for biases. Techniques include fairness-aware training, bias mitigation strategies, and fairness evaluation metrics.

```python
# Example bias detection code
def detect_bias(model, prompt):
    # Generate multiple texts from the same prompt
    generated_texts = [model.generate_text(prompt) for _ in range(100)]
    
    # Analyze generated texts for bias
    # Implement your bias detection logic here
    # Example: Check for biased language or stereotypes
    
    # Return results
    return bias_score
```

Based on bias detection results, iterate on the model architecture, training data, or bias mitigation techniques.

### 5. Deployment on AWS EKS

To deploy the model on AWS EKS, you would typically follow these steps:

- Dockerize the model: Create a Dockerfile to package the model and its dependencies into a Docker container.
- Build the Docker image: Build the Docker image containing the model.
- Push Docker image to ECR: Push the Docker image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
- Deploy on EKS: Deploy the Docker container on AWS EKS cluster using Kubernetes manifests.

Example Kubernetes manifest (`deployment.yaml`):

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: betgpt-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: betgpt
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: betgpt
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: betgpt-container
        image: <your_ecr_repository>/betgpt:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Apply the deployment:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

Expose the deployment:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment betgpt-deployment --type=LoadBalancer --port=80 --target-port=80
```

This exposes the model as a service accessible via an external IP address.

This is a high-level overview, and actual implementation may require adjustments based on specific requirements and configurations. Additionally, ensure proper security, scalability, and monitoring practices are in place for production deployments.
