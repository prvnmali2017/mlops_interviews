# Horse Racing Prediction System

This repository provides a comprehensive guide to building a Horse Racing Prediction System using machine learning and MLOps practices.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing:

- Collect historical horse racing data, including information such as horse name, age, weight, jockey, trainer, track conditions, and race results.
- Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers.
- Feature engineering: Extract relevant features from the data that can be used for prediction, such as win percentage, average race time, and jockey's win rate.

## Model Training and Evaluation:

- Choose a Model: Select a classification model such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or random forest to predict the probability of a horse winning based on historical data and features.
- Prepare the Data: Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets.
- Train the Model: Train the chosen model on the training set and monitor its performance using metrics such as accuracy and loss.
- Evaluate the Model: Assess the trained model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Iterate and Improve: Experiment with different hyperparameters, algorithms, or feature engineering techniques to enhance the model's performance.

## MLOps Implementation:

- Version Control: Utilize Git to track changes to the model code and data, enabling easy reverting to previous versions if needed.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD): Implement a pipeline that automates building, testing, and deploying the model to a production environment to ensure its up-to-date performance.
- Monitoring and Logging: Monitor the model's performance in production and log any errors or issues to debug and enhance its performance over time.
- Feedback Loop: Gather feedback from users to iterate on the model training and deployment process, ensuring it meets user needs effectively.

## User Interface:

- Develop a user interface allowing users to input horse statistics and receive predictions.
- Display the model's prediction for the horse with the higher chances of winning, along with a confidence score.
- Provide access to historical data and model performance metrics for users' reference.

## Iterative Approach:

- Continuously gather feedback from users to improve the model's performance.
- Regularly retrain the model with new data and update the deployment environment.
- Monitor the model's performance in production and make necessary adjustments.

## Building BetGPT using PyTorch:

```python
import torch
from torch import nn

class BetGPT(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super(BetGPT, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc3 = ...
