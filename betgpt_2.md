## Setup

To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Ensure you have access to a Kubernetes cluster for deployment.

## Usage

1. **Building Data Pipelines**: Use the code provided in the `data_pipelines` directory to build your data pipelines. Ensure to handle data preprocessing and cleaning to mitigate bias.
2. **Building BetGPT Model**: Use the code in the `betgpt_model` directory to build and train the BetGPT model. You can iterate on the model architecture and hyperparameters to improve performance.
3. **Detecting Bias**: Utilize the trained BetGPT model to detect bias in your data pipelines. This involves integrating the model into your pipeline and analyzing the model's predictions.
4. **Deploying in Kubernetes**: Follow the instructions in the `deployment` directory to deploy the BetGPT model in a production Kubernetes environment. Ensure to configure scalability, monitoring, and logging for efficient operation.

## Contributing

Contributions to BetGPT are welcome! Please follow the guidelines outlined in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

Here's a simple architecture diagram:

This diagram illustrates the flow from data sources through preprocessing, model training, bias detection, and deployment in Kubernetes.

With this structure, you can dive into each directory to find the relevant code and resources for building, training, and deploying the BetGPT model. Let me know if you need more details on any specific part!
